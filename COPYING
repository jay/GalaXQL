Any resemblance to real persons living or dead is purely 
coincidental. Prof. Guru is meant to be a generic, wise 
professor figure, and thus may resemble any number of people.

While effort has been made to make this tutorial as flawless 
as we could, it's entirely possible that some mistake has 
creeped in.

The program code contains SQLite, which is public domain, 
and wxWidgets, which has its own, rather liberal license.
