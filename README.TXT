NOTE: When launched for the first time, GalaXQL first generates the database. This may take some time, so please be patient.

Note for Mac users - Apparently something has changed in the last few Mac OS updates, and the universal build for intel is broken. You can still use the 2.0 version by forcing it to run under Rosetta. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Version 2.0 introduces better layout, new rendering mode for lower-end computers, optional rendering of the 3d coordinate axes, updated SQLite database engine with CHECK constraints, and various little fixes and rephrasings.

Version 2.1 introduces a faster SQLite engine, a Scintilla-based SQL editor, and various little fixes and rephrasings.

Sources should compile fine for both ANSI and Unicode builds, so GalaXQL compiles under Ubuntu now, given that all neccessary development packages are installed, of course. The source package also contains the required data files.
