<html><body><font size=-1>That's all for now. I hope you've found GalaXQL useful, and I also hope 
that you haven't found me too irritating..<br>
<br>
You can check for updates on GalaXQL and other cool stuff from the author's website, at<br>

Also, send the author some mail! One of the biggest motivations for writing free software like 
this is getting comments from people, and it's always nice to hear when people find your 
programs to be useful.<br>

If you played with this program as a part of some sql course, let us know!<br>

Take care,<br>
