<p>Beginning in version 2.0, SQLite supports transactions with
rollback and atomic commit.</p>

<p>The optional transaction name is ignored. SQLite currently 
does not allow nested transactions.</p>

<p>
No changes can be made to the database except within a transaction.
Any command that changes the database (basically, any SQL command
other than SELECT) will automatically start a transaction if
one is not already in effect.  Automatically started transactions
are committed at the conclusion of the command.
</p>

<p>
Transactions can be started manually using the BEGIN
command.  Such transactions usually persist until the next
COMMIT or ROLLBACK command.  But a transaction will also 
ROLLBACK if the database is closed or if an error occurs
and the ROLLBACK conflict resolution algorithm is specified.
See the documentation on the <a href="lang_conflict.html">ON CONFLICT</a>
clause for additional information about the ROLLBACK
conflict resolution algorithm.
</p>

<p>
In SQLite version 3.0.8 and later, transactions can be deferred,
immediate, or exclusive.  Deferred means that no locks are acquired
on the database until the database is first accessed.  Thus with a
deferred transaction, the BEGIN statement itself does nothing.  Locks
are not acquired until the first read or write operation.  The first read
operation against a database creates a SHARED lock and the first
write operation creates a RESERVED lock.   Because the acquisition of
locks is deferred until they are needed, it is possible that another
thread or process could create a separate transaction and write to
the database after the BEGIN on the current thread has executed.
If the transaction is immediate, then RESERVED locks
are acquired on all databases as soon as the BEGIN command is
executed, without waiting for the
database to be used.  After a BEGIN IMMEDIATE, you are guaranteed that
no other thread or process will be able to write to the database or
do a BEGIN IMMEDIATE or BEGIN EXCLUSIVE.  Other processes can continue
to read from the database, however.  An exclusive transaction causes
EXCLUSIVE locks to be acquired on all databases.  After a BEGIN
EXCLUSIVE, you are guaranteed that no other thread or process will
be able to read or write the database until the transaction is
complete.
</p>

<p>
A description of the meaning of SHARED, RESERVED, and EXCLUSIVE locks
is available <a href="lockingv3.html">separately</a>.
</p>

<p>
The default behavior for SQLite version 3.0.8 is a
deferred transaction.  For SQLite version 3.0.0 through 3.0.7,
deferred is the only kind of transaction available.  For SQLite
version 2.8 and earlier, all transactions are exclusive.
</p>

<p>
The COMMIT command does not actually perform a commit until all
pending SQL commands finish.  Thus if two or more SELECT statements
are in the middle of processing and a COMMIT is executed, the commit
will not actually occur until all SELECT statements finish.
</p>

<p>
An attempt to execute COMMIT might result in an SQLITE_BUSY return code.
This indicates that another thread or process had a read lock on the database
that prevented the database from being updated.  When COMMIT fails in this
way, the transaction remains active and the COMMIT can be retried later
after the reader has had a chance to clear.
