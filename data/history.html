GalaXQL started as a school project at EVTEK Polytechnic (www.evtek.fi).<br>
<br>
Jari Komppa was taking an SQL course, and the course included some kind of loosely defined project. Jari had been looking into wxWidgets at the time, and figured that combining OpenGL with SQL might end up with a fun project.<br>
<br>
After a while the project transformed into the SQL teaching application you're running right now.<br>
