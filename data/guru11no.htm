Hm, that doesn't match with what I'm getting.<br>
<br>
Consider the problem; you have several things that you'll have to do.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>You have to find what the maximum planet orbit distance is
  <li>You have to find which planet has the maximum value
  <li>Finally, you'll have to insert the star id the planet has to the hilight table
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Also make sure you wipe the old hilights that you might have before beginning.
