<html><body><font size=-1>SQL stands for the standard Structured Query Language.<br>
<br>
What it actually is could be called Somewhat Standard Entry Format For More Than Just Queries, but SSEFFMTJQ is somewhat awkward, so SQL it is.<br>
<br>
With queries the user (or a program) can ask the database for information. The simplest query you can enter looks like this:<br>
<br>
<table border=0 width=100% bgcolor=#f0f0f0><tr><td>
<font color=blue>SELECT 3</font><br>
<font size=-2>(<a href="SELECT 3">Try it!</a>)</font></td></tr></table>
<br>
If you go and try that out, you'll find that the database will return '3', which is what you asked for. (You can hop between the query results tab and this one whenever you want. I won't be going anywhere).<br>
<br>
The database can also do some basic (and some less-basic) mathematical operations, such as addition (+), substraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/). You can also use parenthesis to write more complicated calculations (such as (2+2)*3).<br>
<br>
Note that the operations supported by the database vary from one database to another. So much for 'standard'..<br>
<br>
The results will depend on the data type entered; if you write 5/2, the result will be 2. If you write 5.0/2.0 instead, the result will be 2.5.<br>

<b>As your very first task</b>, use SQL to calculate the number of seconds in one day (where day is 24 hours, hour is 60 minutes and a minute is 60 seconds).
