  Welcome!<br>
  <br>
  I am Professor Alfred T. Guru <font color=red>[guu-ruu]</font>, your virtual guide through this SQL tutorial disguised as a galaxy manipulation application.<br>
  <br>
  I'll go through the basics of SQL with you. If you wish to skip to some later chapter, you can use the selection box below my mugshot.<br>
  <br>
  There are two other tabs (in addition to this one where you can find me). First one is 'Query Results', where you'll find the results for your SQL queries. The other tab, 'Reference', contains some SQL reference material that you may find handy.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from these tabs, there's the galaxy map on the left. You can drag the bar between the galaxy map and this 'action area' to make the galaxy map bigger or smaller. You can click on the galaxy map (or even drag on it) to look at the galaxy map from different directions. The galaxy view will get interesting in chapter 6 or so.<br>
  <br>
  Below the galaxy map you can find the most important tool, namely the SQL query editor, which is kind of the whole point of GalaXQL.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, you can find some options in the pulldown menus.<br>
  <br>
  Feel free to look around. When you're done, come back and click on the button below.
