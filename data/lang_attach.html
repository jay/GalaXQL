<p>The ATTACH DATABASE statement adds a preexisting database 
file to the current database connection.  If the filename contains 
punctuation characters it must be quoted.  The names 'main' and 
'temp' refer to the main database and the database used for 
temporary tables.  These cannot be detached.  Attached databases 
are removed using the <a href="lang_detach.html">DETACH DATABASE</a> 
statement.</p>

<p>You can read from and write to an attached database and you
can modify the schema of the attached database.  This is a new
feature of SQLite version 3.0.  In SQLite 2.8, schema changes
to attached databases were not allowed.</p>

<p>You cannot create a new table with the same name as a table in 
an attached database, but you can attach a database which contains
tables whose names are duplicates of tables in the main database.  It is 
also permissible to attach the same database file multiple times.</p>

<p>Tables in an attached database can be referred to using the syntax 
<i>database-name.table-name</i>.  If an attached table doesn't have 
a duplicate table name in the main database, it doesn't require a 
database name prefix.  When a database is attached, all of its 
tables which don't have duplicate names become the 'default' table
of that name.  Any tables of that name attached afterwards require the table 
prefix. If the 'default' table of a given name is detached, then 
the last table of that name attached becomes the new default.</p>

<p>
Transactions involving multiple attached databases are atomic,
assuming that the main database is not ":memory:".  If the main
database is ":memory:" then 
transactions continue to be atomic within each individual
database file. But if the host computer crashes in the middle
of a COMMIT where two or more database files are updated,
some of those files might get the changes where others
might not.
Atomic commit of attached databases is a new feature of SQLite version 3.0.
In SQLite version 2.8, all commits to attached databases behaved as if
the main database were ":memory:".
</p>

<p>There is a compile-time limit of 10 attached database files.</p>
